<h1>Automatic Diagnostic Tool for Detection of Regional Wall Motion Abnormality from Echocardiogram </h1>
 <p>Purpose: The echocardiogram is an ultrasound imaging modality,employed to assess cardiac abnormalities. The Regional Wall Motion Abnormality (RWMA) is the occurrence of abnormal or absent contractility of a region of the heart muscle. 
  Conventional assessment of RWMA is based on visual interpretation of endocardial excursion and myocardial thickening from the echocardiogram videos. Wall motion assessment accuracy depends on the experience of the sonographer. 
  Current automated methods highly depend on the preprocessing steps such as segmentation of ventricle part or manually finding systole and diastole frames from an echocardiogram. Additionally, state-ofthe-art methods majorly make use of images rather than videos, 
  which specifically lack the usage of temporal information associated with an echocardiogram. The deep learning models used, employ highly complex networks with billions of trainable parameters. Further, the existing models used on video data add to the computational intensity because of the high frame rates of echocardiogram videos.
Methods: We developed a novel deep learning architecture EC3DNet
(Echo-Cardio 3D Net), which captures the temporal information
for identifying regional wall motion abnormality from echocardiogram.
We demonstrate that EC3D-Net can extract temporal
information from even raw echocardiogram videos, at low frame
rates, employing minimal training parameter-based deep architecture..</p>
